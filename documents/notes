* Two Versions to test with:
* version one, the fib is calculated with this function:
    public static int fib(int n) {
        int prev1=0, prev2=1;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            int savePrev1 = prev1;
            prev1 = prev2;
            prev2 = savePrev1 + prev2;
            }
        return prev1;
    }
* with overflow

* version two the fib is calculated with this function:
    private static ArrayList<BigInteger> fibCache = new ArrayList<BigInteger>();
    static {
        fibCache.add(BigInteger.ZERO);
        fibCache.add(BigInteger.ONE);
    }
    public static BigInteger fib(int n) {
        if (n >= fibCache.size()) {
            fibCache.add(n, fib(n-1).add(fib(n-2)));
        }
        return fibCache.get(n);
    }
* without overflow


* to biuld from source with gradle
* in /home/matt/AndroidStudioProjects/TestOne
* run gradlew
./gradlew build
* resulting apk will be located in:
app/build/outputs/apk/

* to build from source with ant
ant release
* resulting apk will be located in:
bin/

* to extract apks
unzip *.apk

* to get raw hex files
xxd classes.dex > *-rawdump.file

* to get the dexdump information
~/Documents/grad\ project/sdk/build-tools/21.1.0/dexdump -d -f -h classes.dex > *-dexdump.file

* create jar file
jar cf *

* to extract jar
jar xf *

* dex to jar

**** JARG ****
* to run jarg errors out without -nobco flag
java -jar ~/Documents/grad\ project/obfuscators/jarg/jarg.jar -nobco *.jar
**** JARG ****
	**** Works ****

**** CLASSENCRYPT ****
* running classencrypt does not seem to work with my android application
* and with no real help on their page I cannot fix what the problem is
* because of this I will not be using classencrypt anymore
**** CLASSENCRYPT ****
	**** Does not Work ****

**** JODE ****
*JODE - does not seem to work, every option I choose it creates
* just the jar archive and nothing else so this one is being
* skipped as well
java -cp jode-1.1.2-pre1.jar jode.obfuscator.Main script
**** JODE ****
	**** Does not Work ****

**** JBCO ****
* in sootall/soot-2.5.0/lib run for GUI
java -cp soot-2.5.0.jar soot.jbco.gui.JBCOViewer
* for command line
java -cp soot-2.5.0.jar soot.jbco.Main
* not going to use because it is not for commercial use
**** JBCO ****
	**** Does not Work ****

**** KlassMaster ****
* created a script for it to use based on the progard settings
* to run copied the ZKM.jar file into the folder
* Documents/grad project/sdk/tools/proguard/
* changed the proguard.jar name to proguard.jar.bak
* changed ZKM.jar to proguard.jar
* this allows for the execution of the ZKM obfuscator
* ZKM.jar looks for the file ZKMScript.txt in the same directory where ant is being run
**** KlassMaster ****
	**** Works ****

**** Allatori ****
* added allatori to the ant build script to be run allong side ant
* edited the allatori.xml file to adjust the obfuscation levels
**** Allatori ****
	***** Works ****


**** Notes on Obfuscation ****

** Proguard **
no BuildConfig class
source_file_idx is set to -1 (indicating that there is no information for this value)
annotations_off is set to 0
no positions defined
no locals defined
** Proguard **

** JARG **
BuildConfig class present
source_file_idx set to -1
annotations_off is set to 0
no positions defined
no locals defined
** JARG **

** KlassMaster **
no BuildConfig class
source_file_idx set to -1
no positions defined
no locals defined
renames classes
	* so far class Lf; = displayMathsActivity
	*              Lb; = displayWebPageActivity
does string encryption
** KlassMaster **

** Allatori **
no build config class
	added several extra static fields to the class
	all named with a random alphabet character
every class/filed/method access type is now synthetic
class renamed Lcom/package/*
positions for each class have changed
	from being sequential to random number
string encryption
all the classes are still there
** Allatori **

* at this point it was decided that I need to build the apks with ant due to it bringing in the support classes
* and it working with all of the obfuscators
