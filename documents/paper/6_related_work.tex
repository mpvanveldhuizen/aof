\section{Related Work}
Dr. Yiannis Pavlosoglou, researched this same topic but for Java applications. He developed a program called elucidate \cite{elucidate}, which is a Java Obfuscator Fingerprinter and Cracking tool. This tool was able to identify the obfuscator, recover known strings within the file, give an estimate of the complexity, and provide a map of the application given a jar or class file. Dr. Pavlosoglou provided me with a set of lecture slides and sources but was unable to recover the original elucidate tool. This tool was only able to look at Java bytecode and not Dalvik bytecode. Most of Dr. Pavlosoglou's research was targeted for Java. While Java and Dalvik are similar, the Dalvik Virtual Machine has completely different set of bytecode instructions. Consequently, obfuscation tools Dr. Pavlosoglou mentioned in his presentation are either not relevant to Android or no longer available.
